# MyReads Project

Book management app that lets user manage books in different shelfs i.e. "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", "Read".
This app is part of the projects from [React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

## How to Run

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
